# TTN vs. ChirpStack: A LoRaWAN Integration Journey  

**BME280 Sensor Use Case, Network Feasibility Analysis, and Integration for the Gladiolen Project**  

This repository documents the **LoRaWAN-based integration of BME280 environmental sensors**, comparing **The Things Network (TTN)** and **ChirpStack** for real-time data transmission. The insights from this study contribute to the **Gladiolen Smart Waste Management Project**, which monitors **waste bin levels and locations** using **ultrasonic sensors and LoRaWAN communication**.  

Key topics covered:  
- Step-by-step integration of BME280 sensors with **TTN** and **ChirpStack**  
- Feasibility analysis of both LoRaWAN networks  
- Recommendations for implementing LoRa-based waste monitoring  

**Full documentation is available **[here](Documents/LoRaWAN%20Report.pdf)** in this repository.**
